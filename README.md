# Final Project - Sorting Algorithms

## The Team:

Jacob , Leslie, and Tuyetinh

## Introduction

This Team was charged with the task of implementing three different sorting algorithms from class and a new one
found independently. The three sorting algorithms are insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort and the new one is
called gradix sort. This project's purpose is to benchmark these algorithms to compare them to each other to
determine which one has the fastest runtime, the slowest runtime, and their efficiency based on differences in
sequence size and type. A greater purpose of this project is to prepare this Team for future employment by
modeling what project development in a company setting might look like. From day one this Team has scheduled
made weekly plans and objectives that move us closer to product completion. This project process is another step
in preparing the Team for jobs after college.
