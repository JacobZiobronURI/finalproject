# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms take an input sequence of data that can vary in length and order. This input goes through the algorithm and then outputs a sorted sequence. Our Team implemented insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort, and radix sort. We used four different sequence types; sorted, partially sorted, randomly sorted, and reverse sorted in order to benchmark the efficiency of each sorting algorithm. These sequence sizes ranged from the size of 1 to 100,000. 

## How to Run:

Files needed: '''sort.cpp''', '''sort.h''', and '''main.cpp'''

Compile with '''g++ -Wall main.cpp sort.cpp ./sorter'''

Run with '''./sorter <sortAlg>'''
  sortAlg: "insert", "radix", "merge", or "quick"

The program will write data to csv file named '''<sortAlg>Sort.csv''' corresponding to the user-inputted algorithm
