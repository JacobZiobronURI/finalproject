# Final Project - Sorting Algorithms

## The Team:

Jacob Ziobron
Leslie Ortiz
Tuyetinh Nguyen

## Introduction

This Team was charged with the task of implementing three different sorting algorithms from CSC 212 and an additional
new one. The three sorting algorithms from class are insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. The new algorithm is
called gradix sort. This project's purpose is to benchmark these algorithms to compare them to each other to
determine which one has the fastest runtime, the slowest runtime, and their efficiency based on differences in
sequence size and type. A greater purpose of this project is to prepare this Team for future employment by
modeling what project development in a company setting might look like. From day one this Team has scheduled
weekly plans and objectives that move us closer to project completion. This project process is another step
in preparing the Team for jobs after college.

###### Note

*Algorithms (except bubble, which was a collaborative effort) was initially an individual’s projects,
but after completing (or if someone hit a bug), all Team members checked, debugged, improved/refined
each other’s programs as a group
